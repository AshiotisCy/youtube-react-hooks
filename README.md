# youtube-react-hooks
# Download the code and run npm i to install all the necessary Dependencies

# This is a lite version of youtube using react hooks and two of the youtube's API's
# To actually call the API's you need to have your own API key which can be provided when in the google's developers page.

# Create your key and add it to the App.tsx file

# Happy coding :)
